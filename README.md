**Incident Engineering Patterns**

Operational thinking frameworks and log search strategies for real production incidents.

When systems fail, most teams chase symptoms.
Incident Engineering focuses on signal, sequence, ownership, and failure shape.

This repository documents practical patterns used during real-world incident response.

**What This Repository Covers**
+ Log Search Recipes (CloudWatch & beyond)
+ Temporal Failure Patterns
+ Incident Anti-Patterns
+ Ownership & Escalation Heuristics
+ Operational Glossary
+ Live Incident Playbooks

No theory.
No vendor fluff.
Just patterns that work under pressure.

**Philosophy**
Incidents have structure.

They have:
+ A trigger
+ Amplification
+ Signal distortion
+ Human bias
+ Fatigue effects

Most engineers debug tools.
Incident Engineering debugs failure shape.
